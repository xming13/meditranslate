  "PART 2 ": "",
  "1. What is COVID-19? ": "",
  "COVID-19 (more specifically, a coronavirus) is the disease identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China": "",
  "2. What are the symptoms of COVID-19?": "",
  "The most common symptoms are fever, tiredness and dry cough. Some patients also have runny nose, sore throat or diarrhoea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.\nSome people become infected but remain asymptomatic.\nIt can however, also cause lung infection, or pneumonia.": "",
  "3. How does COVID-19 spread?": "",
  "People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The virus spreads via respiratory droplets (sharing saliva, utensils, being in close contact or through direct contact with droplets on surfaces and materials).": "",
  "4. What is the test for COVID-19 like?": "",
  "It is a swab test inserted in your nostril or at the back of your throat. It will last about 10 seconds. There might be a slight discomfort, however it is not significantly painful.": "",
  "5. What happens if I am tested positive for COVID-19?": "",
  "Arrangements will be made for you to be warded or sent to a community isolation facility, to be placed under observation. You will be observed for deterioration. You might require X-Rays and blood tests as well. Repeated testing of your respiratory samples (via nose or throat) will be done on a regular basis, usually 24 hours apart. If you test negative twice consecutively, you can be discharged back to your home/dorm to continue 2 weeks of isolation at home.": "",
  "6. Will I die from COVID-19?": "",
  "It is normal to worry about how COVID-19 might affect you or your loved ones. In 80% of cases, infections from COVID-19 are usually mild and do not even need any treatment. There is a chance of deterioration due to the virus, which happens more commonly in the elderly population or in those with significant pre-existing medical conditions. Only 5% of patients will require ICU care including breathing support or medications to support their blood pressure.": "",
  "7. Is there a treatment for COVID-19?": "",
  "Most cases of COVID-19 infections do not require any treatment, and only require medications to alleviate symptoms. There is currently no established treatment for the 5% of patients with severe disease, however there are many clinical trials ongoing which have shown variable success. Even though there is no established treatment, if you do develop severe disease, you will still receive breathing support and will be given medications to support your blood pressure.": "",
  "8. How much do I have to pay for my treatment?": "",
  "As of Singapore Government's announcement on 7 March 2020, if you are a Singapore Citizen, Singapore resident OR a long term pass holder, your hospital bill will be covered by the Government. This does not apply if you have left Singapore after 27 March 2020 and you are admitted as a suspected COVID-19 case within 14 days of returning.": "",
  "9. I am worried about missing so much work. Will my boss fire me?": "",
  "Your employer is legally mandated to allow your quarantine/treatment. Your employer is also legally bound to continue to pay your salaries even if you are not allowed to leave your dormitory during this Circuit Breaker period. If your employer does not pay your salary within 7 days of the end of the salary period, he can be prosecuted by the Singapore Government.": "",
  "10. I am scared and I want to go home.": "",
  "It is natural to be scared and anxious during this period. For the safety of your family, it is imperative that you follow the instructions given to you by your doctors and the Government. The Singapore Government has made arrangements for you so that we can safely treat you, if you test positive for COVID-19, while protecting others. Singapore has good hospitals and treatment here and will endeavour to give you the best medical care possible.": "",
  "11. How can I make sure I do not get infected with COVID-19?": "",
  "Fortunately, there are some preventive measures you can take to minimise the risk of infection. They are:\n1. Thoroughly washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\n2. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.\n3. Covering your mouth and nose with your elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze.\n4. Maintaining at least 1 metre distance between yourself and anyone else.\n5. Staying indoors if you feel unwell and keep isolated from others. If you develop fever, cough or breathlessness, please seek medical attention early.": ""
